# Task 4: Local Training - Troubleshooting Report

**Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Local Training Successfully Started!  
**Progress**: 100% Complete - All issues resolved, training running successfully

## üìã Overview

Task 4 involves setting up local PaddleOCR training for Thai character recognition. After systematically troubleshooting multiple configuration issues, we have successfully resolved all blocking problems and achieved a working training setup.

## üéâ FINAL SUCCESS - Training Status

**‚úÖ TRAINING IS NOW RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY!**

As of 18:09 on July 30, 2025, PaddleOCR training for Thai character recognition is actively running with:
- **No errors**: All configuration issues resolved
- **Data loading**: Working correctly (109 train iters, 28 val iters)
- **Model architecture**: Properly configured with complete pipeline
- **Training progress**: Active training in progress

## ‚úÖ What We've Successfully Completed

### 1. Environment Setup ‚úÖ
- **Python Environment**: Python 3.10 on Ubuntu 22.04 WSL
- **PaddlePaddle Installation**: Version 3.1.0 (CPU-only due to RTX 5090 CUDA compatibility)
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed (scikit-image, albumentations, rapidfuzz, lmdb, imgaug)
- **PaddleOCR Repository**: Successfully cloned and integrated

### 2. Hardware Configuration ‚úÖ
- **GPU Issue Resolved**: RTX 5090 with CUDA 12.8 incompatible with PaddlePaddle
- **Solution**: Forced CPU-only training mode with `use_gpu: False`
- **Performance Impact**: Accepted slower training for stability

### 3. Dataset Structure Verification ‚úÖ
- **Training Data**: 7,014 images in `thai_data/train/`
- **Validation Data**: 1,754 images in `thai_data/val/`
- **Label Files**: `rec_gt_train.txt` and `rec_gt_val.txt` properly formatted
- **Character Dictionary**: 880 Thai characters in `th_dict.txt`
- **Path Resolution**: Fixed initial path duplication issue

### 4. Configuration Files ‚úÖ
- **Created 3 variants**: `thai_rec_dev.yml`, `thai_rec.yml`, `thai_rec_prod.yml`
- **Path Configuration**: Absolute paths properly set for dataset and dictionary
- **Hyperparameters**: Tuned for different training scenarios
  - Dev: 10 epochs, batch 64, lr 0.001
  - Main: 100 epochs, batch 128, lr 0.001  
  - Prod: 200 epochs, batch 256, lr 0.0005

### 5. Training Scripts ‚úÖ
- **Created**: `scripts/training/run_local_training.py`
- **Features**: Prerequisite checking, dependency validation, GPU/CPU detection
- **Integration**: Properly integrated with PaddleOCR training pipeline

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED RESOLUTION - All Issues Solved

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: KeyError: 'label' - FIXED
**Problem**: `MultiLabelEncode` operator was incompatible with SimpleDataSet for CTC-only training  
**Root Cause**: `MultiLabelEncode` expects multiple label formats (CTC, SAR) but our SVTR_LCNet model only uses CTC  
**Solution Applied**: Replaced `MultiLabelEncode` with `CTCLabelEncode` in config transforms  
**Result**: ‚úÖ Data loading successful, no more KeyError

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: RecursionError - AUTOMATICALLY RESOLVED  
**Problem**: `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded` in copy.deepcopy()  
**Root Cause**: Caused by the same MultiLabelEncode configuration issue  
**Solution**: Fixed automatically when Issue 1 was resolved  
**Result**: ‚úÖ No more recursion errors

### ‚úÖ Issue 3: Dimension Mismatch (First Occurrence) - UNDERSTOOD & CORRECTED
**Problem**: `Y'dims[0] must be equal to 25, but received Y'dims[0] is 192`  
**Misunderstanding**: Initially thought `out_char_num: 25` meant vocabulary size  
**Correct Understanding**: `out_char_num: 25` is sequence length (W//4), not character count  
**Correction Applied**: Reverted `out_char_num` back to 25  
**Result**: ‚úÖ Understanding clarified

### ‚úÖ Issue 4: Dimension Mismatch (Second Occurrence) - RESOLVED
**Problem**: `Y'dims[0] must be equal to 25, but received Y'dims[0] is 192`  
**Root Cause**: Missing **Neck layer** between Backbone (192 dims) and CTCHead (expects reshaped input)  
**Solution Applied**: Added `SequenceEncoder` Neck layer with `encoder_type: reshape`  
**Result**: ‚úÖ Complete model pipeline working

## üîß Complete Solution Applied

### Final Working Configuration:
```yaml
Architecture:
  model_type: rec
  algorithm: SVTR_LCNet
  Transform:
  Backbone:
    name: SVTRNet
    out_char_num: 25      # Sequence length, not vocab size
    out_channels: 192     # Feature dimensions
  Neck:                   # ‚Üê CRITICAL: This was missing!
    name: SequenceEncoder
    encoder_type: reshape
  Head:
    name: CTCHead

# Corrected Transform Pipeline:
transforms:
  - DecodeImage:
      img_mode: BGR
      channel_first: False
  - CTCLabelEncode:       # ‚Üê Changed from MultiLabelEncode
  - RecResizeImg:
      image_shape: [3, 64, 256]
  - KeepKeys:
      keep_keys: ['image', 'label', 'length']
```

## üß† Key Learning Points & Technical Insights

### 1. PaddleOCR Configuration Architecture Understanding
**Critical Discovery**: SVTR models require a complete **Backbone ‚Üí Neck ‚Üí Head** pipeline:
- **Backbone** (SVTRNet): Extracts features ‚Üí outputs 192-dimensional features
- **Neck** (SequenceEncoder): Reshapes features for sequence processing
- **Head** (CTCHead): Processes sequences for CTC loss calculation

**Lesson**: Missing any component causes dimension mismatch errors

### 2. Transform Pipeline for Different Model Types
**Key Insight**: Different recognition algorithms require different label encoders:
- **Multi-decoder models** (CTC + SAR): Use `MultiLabelEncode`
- **CTC-only models** (like SVTR_LCNet): Use `CTCLabelEncode`

**Lesson**: Always match transform pipeline to model architecture

### 3. Configuration Parameter Meanings
**Corrected Understanding**:
- `out_char_num: 25` = Sequence length (width/downsample_ratio)
- `out_channels: 192` = Feature channel dimensions
- Character vocabulary size = Automatically determined from dictionary file

**Lesson**: Read official documentation carefully to avoid parameter misinterpretation

### 4. Error Cascade Effects
**Observation**: Single configuration error (`MultiLabelEncode`) caused multiple symptoms:
1. Primary: `KeyError: 'label'`
2. Secondary: `RecursionError` in error handling
3. Masking: Made it harder to identify root cause

**Lesson**: Fix primary issues first; secondary issues often resolve automatically
