aws configure
# or use environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-southeast-1
```

### Permission Requirements
Scripts are designed to work with the permissions defined in `required_permissions.json`:
- S3: `paddleocr-*` buckets
- IAM: `paddleocr-*` roles and policies  
- ECR: `paddleocr-*` repositories
- SageMaker: Full access for training and inference
- CloudWatch: Logging access

---

## Common Usage Patterns

### Initial Project Setup
```bash
# 1. Test permissions
python scripts/testing/test_aws_permissions.py

# 2. Setup infrastructure
python scripts/infrastructure/aws_manager.py

# 3. Full deployment (optional)
./scripts/infrastructure/deploy.sh
```

### Training Workflow
```bash
# 1. Prepare data (see thai-letters/ scripts)
python thai-letters/quick_phase1_generator.py
python thai-letters/phase1_paddleocr_converter.py

# 2. Setup training configurations
python scripts/training/setup_training_config.py

# 3. Test locally (optional)
python PaddleOCR/tools/train.py -c configs/rec/thai_rec_dev.yml

# 4. Deploy to SageMaker
python scripts/continue_deployment_v2.py

# 5. Monitor training progress
aws logs tail /aws/sagemaker/TrainingJobs --follow
```

### Docker Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Update dependencies
# Edit requirements.txt with new packages

# 2. Test Docker build locally
docker build -f Dockerfile.sagemaker -t test-thai-ocr .

# 3. Clear cache if needed
docker system prune -af

# 4. Deploy with updated container
python scripts/continue_deployment_v2.py
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check permissions
python scripts/testing/test_aws_permissions.py

# Check AWS CLI config
aws configure list
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Permission Denied Errors**:
- Run `python test_aws_permissions.py` to validate access
- Check that resource names follow `paddleocr-*` pattern
- Verify AWS credentials are current

**Training Job Failures**:
- Check CloudWatch logs via AWS Console
- Verify S3 paths and data format
- Ensure Docker image is properly built and pushed

**Docker Build Issues**:
- **ModuleNotFoundError for dependencies**: Update `requirements.txt` with missing packages
- **libGL.so.1 missing**: Add `libgl1-mesa-glx` to Dockerfile system packages
- **Container build failures**: Clear Docker cache with `docker system prune -af`
- **Dependency conflicts**: Check package versions in requirements.txt

**PaddleOCR Training Issues**:
- **Distributed training errors**: Disable GPU and distributed training for SageMaker
- **Data path errors**: Ensure S3 paths point to correct directory structure
- **rapidfuzz missing**: Add `rapidfuzz>=2.0.0` to requirements.txt
- **scikit-image missing**: Add `scikit-image>=0.19.0` to requirements.txt

**S3 Data Structure Issues**:
- **FileNotFoundError for labels**: Check that `rec_gt_train.txt` and `rec_gt_val.txt` exist
- **Image path errors**: Verify thai_data/train/ contains training images
- **Path configuration**: Update data_dir in training config to include '/rec/' suffix

**Resource Already Exists**:
- Scripts handle existing resources gracefully
- Use unique suffixes for resource names when needed

**ECR Authentication Issues**:
- Run `aws ecr get-login-password` to refresh Docker login
- Verify ECR repository exists and has proper permissions
- Check AWS region configuration matches ECR region

## Script Maintenance

### Adding New Scripts
When creating new scripts:

1. **Follow naming conventions**:
   - Use descriptive names: `feature_action.py` or `action_feature.sh`
   - Place in appropriate `scripts/` subdirectory if needed

2. **Update documentation**:
   - Add entry to this file (`doc/scripts.md`)
   - Include purpose, usage, and when to use
   - Update other relevant documentation

3. **Follow code standards**:
   - Include docstrings and comments
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Test with limited permissions

4. **Update related files**:
   - Add to `.gitignore` if generates temporary files
   - Update `README.md` if script is user-facing
   - Update `development-task.md` if part of workflow

### Script Organization

```
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/             # AWS resource management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ aws_manager.py         # Main AWS resource manager
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ deploy.sh              # Complete deployment automation
â”œâ”€â”€ ml/                        # Machine learning operations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sagemaker_trainer.py   # SageMaker training jobs
â”œâ”€â”€ testing/                   # Testing and validation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_aws_permissions.py # AWS permissions validation
â””â”€â”€ utils/                     # Utility scripts (future)
    â”œâ”€â”€ data_helpers.py        # Data processing utilities
    â””â”€â”€ monitoring.py          # Monitoring and alerting
```

## Integration with Other Components

### With Terraform
- Scripts complement Terraform for dynamic resource creation
- Use scripts for resources that need runtime configuration
- Terraform handles static infrastructure

### With thai-letters/
- Data preparation scripts in `thai-letters/` generate training data
- Scripts in `scripts/` handle cloud deployment and training
- Clear separation between data generation and cloud operations

### With Documentation
- All scripts must be documented in this file
- Usage examples should be practical and tested
- Keep documentation updated when scripts change
