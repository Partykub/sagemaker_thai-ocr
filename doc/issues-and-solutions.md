# Issues and Solutions Log

This document tracks all major issues encountered during the Thai OCR project development and their solutions.

## 🎯 Project Timeline

### Phase 1: Data Generation ✅ (Completed)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Goal**: Generate synthetic Thai text images for training

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **Font Compatibility**: Some Thai fonts didn't render properly
   - **Solution**: Tested multiple fonts, selected compatible ones
   - **Result**: Successfully generated 9,408 diverse images

2. **Character Set Optimization**: Original dictionary had too many non-Thai characters
   - **Problem**: 880 characters including English letters and symbols
   - **Solution**: Created `th_dict_optimized.txt` with 74 Thai-only characters
   - **Result**: 91.6% noise reduction

#### Final Results:
- ✅ 9,408 synthetic Thai images generated
- ✅ Multiple fonts and styles included
- ✅ Proper file naming and organization
- ✅ Ground truth labels created

### Phase 2: Data Conversion ✅ (Completed)
**Duration**: 1 day  
**Goal**: Convert generated data to PaddleOCR training format

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **Path Management**: Relative vs absolute paths in conversion
   - **Solution**: Standardized on relative paths from project root
   - **Result**: Consistent data structure

2. **Train/Validation Split**: Needed proper data distribution
   - **Solution**: 80/20 split with random sampling
   - **Result**: 7,526 training / 1,882 validation images

#### Final Results:
- ✅ Proper PaddleOCR directory structure
- ✅ Train/validation split completed
- ✅ Label files in correct format
- ✅ Data ready for training

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Setup ✅ (Completed)
**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Goal**: Set up AWS infrastructure for training

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **AWS Permissions**: Complex permission requirements for SageMaker
   - **Solution**: Created `required_permissions.json` with comprehensive policies
   - **Result**: All required permissions documented and applied

2. **Docker Build**: Large Docker image for PaddleOCR training
   - **Solution**: Multi-stage build with optimization
   - **Result**: Working Docker image pushed to ECR

3. **Resource Naming**: Consistent naming convention needed
   - **Solution**: All resources prefixed with `paddleocr-`
   - **Result**: Clean resource organization

#### Final Results:
- ✅ Terraform infrastructure deployed
- ✅ S3 buckets created and configured
- ✅ ECR repository with Docker image
- ✅ IAM roles and policies set up
- ✅ SageMaker training job configuration

### Phase 4: Model Training ✅ (Completed)
**Duration**: 25+ hours (1 day, 1 hour, 17 minutes)  
**Goal**: Train Thai OCR model on SageMaker

#### Issues Encountered:
1. **Instance Type Selection**: Needed GPU for reasonable training time
   - **Solution**: Used ml.g4dn.xlarge (single GPU)
   - **Result**: Completed training in ~25 hours

2. **Training Configuration**: Multiple config files needed testing
   - **Solution**: Created dev (10 epochs), main (100 epochs), prod (200 epochs) configs
   - **Result**: Used 100-epoch configuration successfully

3. **Resource Monitoring**: Long training needed monitoring
   - **Solution**: Created monitoring scripts to track progress
   - **Result**: Successfully tracked training to completion

#### Training Details:
- **Job Name**: `paddleocr-thai-training-1754289824`
- **Instance**: ml.g4dn.xlarge
- **Dataset**: 9,408 images (80/20 split)
- **Architecture**: SVTR_LCNet
- **Duration**: 25+ hours
- **Cost**: ~$25 USD
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

#### Final Results:
- ✅ Model training completed successfully
- ✅ 6.5MB model artifacts generated
- ✅ Model uploaded to S3
- ✅ Training logs and metrics available

### Phase 5: Model Deployment ⚠️ (In Progress)
**Duration**: Ongoing  
**Goal**: Deploy trained model for inference

#### Current Issues:

##### Issue 1: PaddleOCR Version Compatibility ❌
**Problem**: Training environment uses different PaddleOCR version than local environment
```
AttributeError: 'paddle.fluid.libpaddle.AnalysisConfig' object has no attribute 'set_optimization_level'
```

**Root Cause**: 
- SageMaker training used PaddleOCR 2.x framework
- Local environment has newer PaddleOCR with different API

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. ✅ **Model File Structure**: Created all required inference files
   - `inference.pdiparams` (copied from model.pdparams)
   - `inference.pdmodel` (copied from model.pdparams)  
   - `config.yml` (copied from training config)

2. ✅ **Multiple Loading Methods Tested**:
   - Standard PaddleOCR initialization
   - Direct TextRecognizer class
   - Custom Args class matching working examples

3. ❌ **All Methods Failed**: API incompatibility prevents model loading

**Potential Solutions (Not Yet Tested)**:
1. **Docker Environment Matching**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it paddlepaddle/paddle:2.4.2-gpu-cuda11.2-cudnn8
   pip install paddleocr==2.6.1.3
   ```

2. **Version Downgrade**:
   ```bash
   pip install paddlepaddle==2.4.2
   pip install paddleocr==2.6.1.3
   ```

3. **Model Re-export**: Export model using compatible inference format

##### Issue 2: Inference Configuration ❌
**Problem**: Model requires specific configuration for inference
```
neither inference.json nor inference.pdmodel was found
```

**Solutions Applied**:
- ✅ Created missing inference files
- ✅ Added configuration files to model directory
- ⚠️ Still requires compatible framework version

##### Issue 3: Dictionary Management ✅ (Solved)
**Problem**: Multiple dictionary versions causing confusion

**Solution Applied**:
- ✅ Using optimized dictionary (74 characters vs 880)
- ✅ Clear documentation of dictionary differences
- ✅ Test scripts updated to handle both versions

#### Current Status:
- ✅ Model artifacts downloaded and properly structured
- ✅ All required inference files created
- ❌ Cannot load model due to PaddleOCR version compatibility
- 🔄 Investigating version compatibility solutions

## 🎯 Summary

### ✅ Major Achievements:
1. **Complete Data Pipeline**: 9,408 high-quality synthetic Thai images
2. **Successful Training**: 25+ hour SageMaker training completed
3. **Infrastructure**: Full AWS setup with Terraform automation
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for all processes

### ⚠️ Current Blockers:
1. **PaddleOCR Version Compatibility**: Primary blocker for model deployment
2. **Inference Environment**: Need matching training/inference environment

### 🎯 Next Steps:
1. **Environment Matching**: Set up compatible PaddleOCR environment
2. **Model Testing**: Validate model performance once compatibility resolved
3. **Deployment Options**: Explore SageMaker endpoints vs local inference
4. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune inference speed and accuracy

### 💡 Lessons Learned:
1. **Version Management**: Critical to maintain compatible environments
2. **Framework Dependencies**: PaddleOCR version changes break compatibility
3. **Documentation**: Detailed issue tracking saves debugging time
4. **Infrastructure First**: AWS setup complexity requires early planning

## 🔍 Debugging Resources

### Model Files Structure:
```
models/sagemaker_trained/best_model/
├── best_accuracy.pdopt      # Training optimizer state
├── best_accuracy.pdparams   # Best checkpoint weights
├── config.yml               # Training configuration
├── inference.pdiparams      # Inference weights (created)
├── inference.pdmodel        # Inference model (created)
├── inference.pdopt          # Inference optimizer (created)
├── model.pdopt              # Final optimizer state
└── model.pdparams           # Final model weights
```

### Error Patterns:
1. `set_optimization_level` error → PaddleOCR version mismatch
2. `inference.pdmodel not found` → Missing inference files
3. `TextRecognizer` import error → Framework compatibility issue
4. Empty string results → Model loading successful but inference broken

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Check model files
python test_simple_model.py

# Comprehensive testing (when working)
python scripts/ml/comprehensive_test.py

# Direct PaddleOCR testing (when working)
python scripts/ml/paddleocr_inference.py
```
