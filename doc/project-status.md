### **⚠️ CURRENT CHALLENGES**

#### **🎯 Model Accuracy Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)**
```
Current Results:
- Model loads successfully: 100%
- Inference executes: 93.3% (14/15 samples)
- Character accuracy: Very Low (~0%)
- Single character output: ✅ Working
- Configuration consistency: ✅ Verified
```

**Problem**: Model produces single characters but predictions don't match ground truth.

**Example**:
```
Ground Truth: 'อุ้' → Predicted: 'ซ'
Ground Truth: 'ง' → Predicted: 'ก'
Ground Truth: 'ป' → Predicted: 'ซ'
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. ✅ **Not configuration issues** (verified exact match)
2. ✅ **Not model loading issues** (loads successfully)
3. ⚠️ **Possible training data quality issues**
4. ⚠️ **Possible preprocessing mismatches**
5. ⚠️ **Possible character encoding issues**

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (Priority Order)
